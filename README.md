# Mood for a movie

An app which suggests movies to watch based on the user's moods

## Tech

Using React, Redux, Router5 and bootstrapped with Webpack2.

Based on this simple [Webpack2 React seed project](https://github.com/tpina/react-webpack2-seed) and then swapping out the react-router for [Router5](https://github.com/router5/redux-router5) using this [redux-router5 example](https://github.com/router5/examples/tree/master/apps/react-redux)

Utilizing 3rd party APIs:
* [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org)
* [Netflix Roulette API](https://netflixroulette.net/api/)
* [iTunes Search API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/#searching)

Temp examples:
```

GET https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=inside+out&entity=movie
```
